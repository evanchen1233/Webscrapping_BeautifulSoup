# Webscrapping_BeautifulSoup

Webscrapping with BeautifulSoup from car sales website

Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

Getting to know the package "BeautifulSoup" in Python.

Scrapping key data from website "https://www.sydneycars.com.au/" includes car model, year make, km travelled and price.

Scrapping from all pages by locating the max page number and loop through.

Store data in dataframe for better table looking.
